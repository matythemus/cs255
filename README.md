Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client for the driver pass project was a guy that wanted to help out his community and try to make the chance of people taking the drivers permit test for the first time a better and easier process. The members of driverpass wanted a website where they could give students helpful teaching material about driving and drivers safety, also while having the ability to schedule driving lessons.
What did you do particularly well?
I think that I did the business requirements document pretty well and that it had most all of the necessary information that they would need to get a start on the system.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think that if i needed to revise a part of the project it would be the diagrams, some of them did not look the best and or maybe were not the clearest  so I think that they could have used some more work.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I tried to implement the needs that they told us about because we needed to try to make the project exactly what they wanted and make the clients happy so it is important to produce good work and could help us gain a good reputation as a company if we get it right how they would like the system to be.
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I think that we learned some helpful techniques in this class that will help us to create and analyze the design process more and better than before. I think that one strategy that is a great help is how we broke it down and make the diagrams but not for the whole system but we learned to sometimes only diagram a specific use case then later you can pull in all together but in the beginning it is easier to sort out and cleanup just a smaller section of work.
